## PotPvP

Depends: mSpigot/SourSpigot, ProtocolLib, WorldEdit/Fawe.

## Purpose

As Drizzy's PotPvP-ND looks broken, I made this version which is the closest to the default source that you 
can find anywhere, without the qLib depend.

Alot of skids are trying to sell this and its very unfair for the people that actually buy it.
On the other hand, the people that have it like to make it seem like its very exclusive when its not.
This is the actual potpvp source with qLib removed and I'm giving this for free. *(copied from drizzy)*
